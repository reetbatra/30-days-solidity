# 30 Days of Solidity ⛓️✨

This repository is my **30 Contracts in 30 Days** challenge.  
The goal is to **revise Solidity** by building one small smart contract each day.  

---

## 📅 Progress  

### **Day 1: ClickCounter.sol**  
A simple counter, like a digital clicker. The contract has a function `increase()` that increments a stored number each time it’s called and `decrease()` that decrements the stored number each time it's called.
It demonstrates how to declare and update a state variable (`uint`) and how to write functions that modify contract state.  

---

### **Day 2: SaveMyName.sol**  
A basic profile contract where users can save their name and a short bio.  
It shows how to store text data (`string`) on the blockchain and how to create functions to save and retrieve this information.  

---

### **Day 3: PollStation.sol**  
A polling station contract that allows voting for candidates. Candidate names are stored in an array, and a mapping keeps track of vote counts.  
It demonstrates structured data management using arrays and mappings.  

---

### **Day 4: AuctionHouse.sol**  
A simple auction system where users can place bids, and the highest bidder wins when the auction ends.  
It shows how to compare values with conditionals (`if/else`) and how to work with time using `block.timestamp`.  

---

## 🚀 Coming Soon  
The rest of the contracts (up to Day 30) will cover topics like token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721), access control, payments, inheritance, and more.
